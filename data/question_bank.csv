The equation above represents the relationship between <i>a</i>, the number of small boxes, and <i>b</i>, the number of large boxes, the customer had shipped. If the customer had 3 small boxes shipped, how many large boxes were shipped?",,3,4,5,6,4,"Choice B is correct. It's given that a represents the number of small boxes and b represents the number of large boxes the customer had shipped. If the customer had 3 small boxes shipped, then a = 3. Substituting 3 for a in the equation 3a + 4b = 25 yields 3(3) + 4b = 25 or 9 + 4b = 25. Subtracting 9 from both sides of the equation yields 4b = 16. Dividing both sides of this equation by 4 yields b = 4. Therefore, the customer had 4 large boxes shipped. Choices A, C, and D are incorrect. If the number of large boxes shipped is 3, then b = 3. Substituting 3 for b in the given equation yields 3a + 4(3) = 25 or 3a + 12 = 25. Subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation and then dividing by 3 yields a = 13/3. However, it's given that the number of small boxes shipped, a, is 3, not 13/3, so b cannot equal 3. Similarly, if b = 5 or b = 6, then a = 5/3 or a = 1/3, respectively, which is also not true.","The problem provides an equation, 3a + 4b = 25, where 'a' is the number of small boxes and 'b' is the number of large boxes. We are given that the customer shipped 3 small boxes, so a = 3. To find the number of large boxes 'b', we substitute a = 3 into the equation.<br>1. Substitute a = 3: 3(3) + 4b = 25<br>2. Simplify: 9 + 4b = 25<br>3. Isolate the term with 'b' by subtracting 9 from both sides: 4b = 25 - 9<br>4. Simplify: 4b = 16<br>5. Solve for 'b' by dividing both sides by 4: b = 16 / 4<br>6. Final Answer: b = 4. The customer shipped 4 large boxes.","This answer is incorrect. This would be true if the number of large boxes was 3, which would make the number of small boxes a fraction.","This is the correct answer. Substituting a=3 into the equation gives 9 + 4b = 25, which solves to 4b = 16, so b = 4.","This answer is incorrect. This would result if you incorrectly solved the equation, perhaps by a calculation error like 25-9=20.",This answer is incorrect. This may result from a calculation error during the solving process.

Maria spends x minutes running each day and y minutes biking each day. Therefore, x + y represents the total number of minutes Maria spent running and biking each day. Because x + y = 75, it follows that 75 is the total number of minutes that Maria spent running and biking each day. Choices A and B are incorrect. The number of minutes Maria spent running each day is represented by x and need not be 75. Similarly, the number of minutes that Maria spends biking each day is represented by y and need not be 75. The number of minutes Maria spends running each day and biking each day may vary; however, the total number of minutes she spends each day on these activities is constant and equal to 75. Choice D is incorrect. The number of minutes Maria spent biking for each minute spent running cannot be determined from the information provided.","The equation is x + y = 75. The problem defines 'x' as the minutes spent running and 'y' as the minutes spent biking. The sum of these two quantities, x + y, therefore represents the total time spent on both activities combined. Since this sum is equal to 75, the number 75 represents the total number of minutes Maria spends running and biking each day.",This is incorrect. The number of minutes spent running is represented by the variable x.,This is incorrect. The number of minutes spent biking is represented by the variable y.,"This is the correct interpretation. The sum of the individual activities (x and y) equals the total, which is 75.","This is incorrect. This would represent a rate or ratio (like y/x), which is not what the equation describes."

How many pieces did the pianist practice if the session lasted 30 minutes?",,1,3,10,30,3,"Choice B is correct. It's given that the equation y = 0.1x models the relationship between the number of different pieces of music a certain pianist practices, y, and the number of minutes in a practice session, x. Since it's given that the session lasted 30 minutes, the number of pieces the pianist practiced can be found by substituting 30 for x in the given equation, which yields y = 0.1(30), or y = 3. Choices A and C are incorrect and may result from misinterpreting the values in the equation. Choice D is incorrect. This is the given value of x, not the value of y.","The model is y = 0.1x. We are given the following definitions: 'y' is the number of pieces practiced, and 'x' is the duration of the practice session in minutes. The question states the session lasted 30 minutes, which means x = 30. We need to find the number of pieces, which is y. Substitute x = 30 into the equation: y = 0.1 * 30. Multiplying 0.1 by 30 is the same as dividing 30 by 10. So, y = 3. The pianist practiced 3 pieces.",This answer is incorrect. This may result from a calculation error.,"This is the correct answer. Substituting x=30 into y=0.1x gives y=0.1(30), which equals 3.","This answer is incorrect. This might result from misinterpreting the relationship, perhaps by dividing 30 by 0.1 instead of multiplying.","This answer is incorrect. 30 is the value of x (the number of minutes), not y (the number of pieces)."

The slope of the line can be found by choosing any two points on the line, such as (4, -2) and (0, -1). Subtracting the y-values results in -2 - (-1) = -1, the change in y. Subtracting the x-values results in 4 – 0 = 4, the change in x. Dividing the change in y by the change in x yields -1/4, the slope. The line intersects the y-axis at (0, -1), so -1 is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept. This information can be expressed in slope-intercept form as the equation y = (-1/4)x - 1. Choice B is incorrect and may result from incorrectly calculating the slope and then misidentifying the slope as the y-intercept. Choice C is incorrect and may result from misidentifying the slope as the y-intercept.

CBQ-M-A-LEITV-E-8adf1335,CBQ-M-A-LEITV-E,Math,Algebra,Linear equations in two variables,Easy,A city's total expense budget for one year was x million dollars. The city budgeted y million dollars for departmental expenses and 201 million dollars for all other expenses. Which of the following represents the relationship between x and y in this context?,,x + y = 201,x - y = 201,2x - y = 201,y - x = 201,x - y = 201,"Choice B is correct. Of the city's total expense budget for one year, the city budgeted y million dollars for departmental expenses and 201 million dollars for all other expenses. This means that the expression y + 201 represents the total expense budget, in millions of dollars, for one year. It's given that the total expense budget for one year is x million dollars. It follows then that the expression y + 201 is equivalent to x, or y + 201 = x. Subtracting y from both sides of this equation yields 201 = x - y. By the symmetric property of equality, this is the same as x - y = 201. Choices A and C are incorrect. Because it's given that the total expense budget for one year, x million dollars, is comprised of the departmental expenses, y million dollars, and all other expenses, 201 million dollars, the expressions x + y and 2x - y both must be equivalent to a value greater than 201 million dollars. Therefore, the equations x + y = 201 and 2x - y = 201 aren't true. Choice D is incorrect. The value of x must be greater than the value of y. Therefore, y - x = 201 can't represent this relationship.","The problem states that the total expense budget is 'x'. This total is made up of two parts: departmental expenses ('y') and all other expenses ('201'). Therefore, we can write the relationship as: Total Expenses = Departmental Expenses + Other Expenses. Substituting the variables and values gives: x = y + 201. To match this with the given options, we can rearrange the equation. Subtracting 'y' from both sides gives: x - y = 201.","This is incorrect. This equation implies the total budget (x) plus departmental expenses (y) equals other expenses, which is not logical.",This is the correct answer. It correctly represents the relationship: Total Budget (x) minus Departmental Expenses (y) equals the remaining Other Expenses (201).,This is incorrect. There is no basis for multiplying the total budget by 2.,"This is incorrect. The total budget x must be larger than the departmental budget y, so x - y must be a positive number. This means y - x would be a negative number, so it cannot equal 201."

Since Fertilizer A contains 60% filler materials by weight, it follows that x pounds of Fertilizer A consists of 0.6x pounds of filler materials. Similarly, y pounds of Fertilizer B consists of 0.4y pounds of filler materials. When x pounds of Fertilizer A and y pounds of Fertilizer B are combined, the result is 240 pounds of filler materials. Therefore, the total amount, in pounds, of filler materials in a mixture of x pounds of Fertilizer A and y pounds of Fertilizer B can be expressed as 0.6x + 0.4y = 240. Choice A is incorrect.

This choice transposes the percentages and incorrectly represents how to take the percentage of a value mathematically. Choice D is incorrect. This choice incorrectly represents how to take the percentage of a value mathematically.","The goal is to write an equation for the total amount of filler materials. <br>1. **Filler from Fertilizer A:** The amount of Fertilizer A is 'x' pounds, and it is 60% filler. To find the weight of the filler, we convert the percentage to a decimal (60% = 0.60) and multiply by the total weight. So, filler from A is 0.60x. <br>2. **Filler from Fertilizer B:** The amount of Fertilizer B is 'y' pounds, and it is 40% filler. The weight of the filler is 0.40y. <br>3. **Total Filler:** The total amount of filler is the sum of the filler from A and B. The problem states this total is 240 pounds. <br>Therefore, the equation is 0.60x + 0.40y = 240.",This is incorrect. This equation incorrectly assigns the 40% filler rate to Fertilizer A (x) and the 60% rate to Fertilizer B (y).,This is the correct answer. It correctly calculates the filler from Fertilizer A (0.6x) and Fertilizer B (0.4y) and sets their sum equal to the total filler amount (240).,"This is incorrect.

Since a 10-ride pass costs $12.50 and g is the number of 10-ride passes Tony buys in a month, the expression 12.50g represents the amount Tony spends on 10-ride passes in a month. Since a single-ride pass costs $1.50 and t is the number of single-ride passes Tony buys in a month, the expression 1.50t represents the amount Tony spends on single-ride passes in a month. Therefore, the sum 12.50g + 1.50t represents the amount he spends on the two types of passes in a month. Since Tony spends a total of $80 on passes in a month, this expression can be set equal to 80, producing 12.50g + 1.50t = 80. Choices A and B are incorrect.

Thus, if the three values of x are 0, 2, and 4, then their corresponding values of y are 8, 148, and 288, respectively, for the given equation. Choice B is incorrect. This table gives values for y = 4x + 70. Choice C is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.","We need to test the given x-values (0, 2, 4) in the equation y = 70x + 8 and see which table has the correct y-values.<br>1. **When x = 0:** y = 70(0) + 8 = 0 + 8 = 8. <br>2. **When x = 2:** y = 70(2) + 8 = 140 + 8 = 148. <br>3. **When x = 4:** y = 70(4) + 8 = 280 + 8 = 288. <br>The correct pairs are (0, 8), (2, 148), and (4, 288). This matches Table A.","This is the correct answer as all three (x, y) pairs satisfy the equation.","This is incorrect. For x=0, y=70, but the equation gives y=8.","This is incorrect. For x=2, y=140. This calculation ignores the '+ 8' part of the equation.","This is incorrect. For x=2, y=132 and for x=4, y=272. These values do not satisfy the equation."

Any line in the xy-plane can be defined by an equation in the form y = mx + b, where m is the slope of the line and b is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept of the line. From the graph, the y-intercept of the line is (0, 3). Therefore, b = 3. The slope of the line is the change in the value of y divided by the change in the value of x for any two points on the line. The line shown passes through (0, 3) and (1, 0), so m = (3-0)/(0-1), or m = -3. Therefore, the equation of the line is y = -3x + 3. Choices A and C are incorrect because the equations given in these choices represent a line with a positive slope. However, the line shown has a negative slope. Choice D is incorrect because the equation given in this choice represents a line with a slope of -1/3. However, the line shown has a slope of -3.","To find the equation of the line, we can use the slope-intercept form, y = mx + b. <br>1. **Find the y-intercept (b):** The graph shows the line crossing the y-axis at the point (0, 3). So, b = 3. <br>2. **Find the slope (m):** The graph also shows the line passing through the point (1, 0). Using the points (0, 3) and (1, 0), we can calculate the slope: <br>m = (change in y) / (change in x) = (0 - 3) / (1 - 0) = -3 / 1 = -3. <br>3. **Write the equation:** Substitute m = -3 and b = 3 into y = mx + b.
