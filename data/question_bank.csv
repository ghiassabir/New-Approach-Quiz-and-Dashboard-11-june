As nearly as I have been able to learn, I was born near a cross-roads post-office called Hale's Ford, and the year was 1858 or 1859. I do not know the month or the day.

Washington is not complaining about his dementia, as in Choice A, and Choice B is flawed in that he is uncertain of his ""identity."" Choice C is flawed in that Washington is not critical of his family; rather, he is critical of the system of slavery that led to the instability/absence of his familial relations.","Washington repeatedly emphasizes his uncertainty about his origins: 'not quite sure of the exact place or exact date,' 'I do not know the month or the day.' This consistent focus on the lack of specific information about his birth highlights a profound sense of disconnection from his own past. This lack of a firm foundation or 'roots' is a central theme. The purpose is to show the deep and personal consequences of being born into slavery, where such basic records and certainties were denied.","This is incorrect. The text discusses a lack of knowledge about his birth, not memory loss due to old age (senility).","This is incorrect.

The recipient of the message would be alerted to the cipher in advance and would thus decode the message upon delivery. The Caesar Shift was simplistic by today's standards, but in an era in which very few could read in the first place, the encryption was effective.

'has been observed' is singular present perfect, but the subject is plural and the action is in the deeper past.","This is incorrect. 'have been observed' is plural present perfect. While the subject is plural, the tense is wrong. The observation of violations happened *before* the DZero study was announced in the past.",This is the correct answer. The past perfect tense 'had been observed' correctly indicates that these observations took place before the main past event of the DZero study's announcement.,"This is incorrect.
