The ratio is now 9/4 : 3/2. To express this ratio in simplest integer form, you can find a common denominator (4) and convert the second fraction: 3/2 = 6/4. So the ratio is 9/4 : 6/4, which simplifies to 9 : 6.
Alternatively, you can multiply both sides of the ratio by the least common multiple of the denominators (4) to clear fractions: (9/4) * 4 : (3/2) * 4 = 9 : 6.
