The given equation can be rewritten as -2t + 3 = 38. Dividing both sides of this equation by -2 yields t + 3 = - 19. Subtracting 3 from both sides of this equation yields t = - 22. Therefore, -22 is the value of t that is the solution to the given equation.","The expression (*t*+3) is a common factor on the left side. 1. Factor out (*t*+3): (5-7)(*t*+3) = 38. 2. Simplify the first part: -2(*t*+3) = 38. 3. Divide both sides by -2: *t*+3 = -19. 4. Subtract 3 from both sides: *t* = -19 - 3 = -22. Alternatively, you could distribute first: (5*t*+15) - (7*t*+21) = 38, which simplifies to -2*t* - 6 = 38. Then -2*t* = 44, and *t* = -22.",,,,

Therefore, of the given choices, $291,700 best approximates the original price of the Glenview Street property.","Let *x* be the original price. This is a reverse percentage problem. 1. A 40% discount means the company paid 100% - 40% = 60% of the original price. This price is 0.60*x*. 2. An additional 20% discount was applied to this new price. This means they paid 100% - 20% = 80% of the discounted price. 3. The final price is 80% of (60% of *x*), which is 0.80 * (0.60*x*) = 0.48*x*. 4. We know the final purchase price from the table is $140,000. So, 0.48*x* = 140,000. 5. Solve for *x*: *x* = 140,000 / 0.48 ≈ 291,666.67. The closest approximation is $291,700.","This is incorrect. This would be the result of dividing the purchase price by 0.4, assuming a single 60% discount was applied. It also confuses a 40% discount with paying 40% of the price.","This is the correct answer. The combined effect of a 40% discount and a subsequent 20% discount is a final price of 48% of the original. 140,000 / 0.48 gives the approximate original price.","This is incorrect. This would be the result of dividing the purchase price by 0.6, ignoring the second 20% discount.","This is incorrect.
