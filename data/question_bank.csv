CB-T4-RW1-Q1,CB-T4-RW-M1,Reading Writing,"Craft and Structure","Words in Context",Easy,"The spacecraft OSIRIS-REx briefly made contact with the asteroid 101955 Bennu in 2020. NASA scientist Daniella DellaGiustina reports that despite facing the unexpected obstacle of a surface mostly covered in boulders, OSIRIS-REx successfully _____ a sample of the surface, gathering pieces of it to bring back to Earth. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","",attached,collected,followed,replaced,collected,"Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft’s contact with the asteroid 101955 Bennu. In this context, ““collected”” means acquired and took away. The text indicates that although the boulders on the asteroid’s surface caused some unforeseen problems, OSIRIS-REx was able to gather a sample to return to Earth. This context suggests that OSIRIS-REx successfully collected a sample of 101955 Bennu. Choice A is incorrect because in this context ““attached”” means connected or affixed. The text indicates that OSIRIS-REx gathered pieces of 101955 Bennu to bring to Earth; it doesn’t suggest that the spacecraft attached anything to the asteroid. Choice C is incorrect because in this context ““followed”” means tracked or traveled behind and the text discusses OSIRIS-REx’s brief encounter with 101955 Bennu during which the spacecraft gathered a sample to bring to Earth. The text doesn’t suggest that the spacecraft tracked the sample, and it’s not clear what it would mean for the spacecraft to travel behind the sample it collected. Choice D is incorrect because in this context ““replaced”” means put back or returned. The text indicates that OSIRIS-REx gathered pieces of 101955 Bennu to bring to Earth but doesn’t suggest that anything was returned to the asteroid.","The question asks for the most logical and precise word to complete the sentence describing OSIRIS-REx's action. The context states that OSIRIS-REx successfully ""a sample of the surface, gathering pieces of it to bring back to Earth."" The phrase ""gathering pieces of it"" strongly implies the act of obtaining or acquiring something. ""Collected"" perfectly fits this meaning, indicating that the spacecraft successfully acquired the sample.","This choice is incorrect. ""Attached"" means to fasten or join something to something else. The text describes the spacecraft ""gathering pieces of"" the asteroid, not attaching anything to it. This word does not fit the context of acquiring a sample.","This is the correct answer. ""Collected"" means to gather or acquire something, which directly aligns with the phrase ""gathering pieces of it to bring back to Earth."" The spacecraft successfully acquired the sample.","This choice is incorrect. ""Followed"" means to move behind something or to track it. The sentence refers to the spacecraft obtaining a sample, not tracking it. It makes no sense for the spacecraft to ""follow"" a sample it is in the process of gathering.","This choice is incorrect. ""Replaced"" means to put something back in its previous place or to substitute one thing for another. The text clearly states OSIRIS-REx was gathering a sample to bring back, not returning or substituting anything on the asteroid's surface."
CB-T4-RW1-Q2,CB-T4-RW-M1,Reading Writing,"Craft and Structure","Words in Context",Medium,"Research conducted by planetary scientist Katarina Miljkovic suggests that the Moon's surface may not accurately _____ early impact events. When the Moon was still forming, its surface was softer, and asteroid or meteoroid impacts would have left less of an impression; thus, evidence of early impacts may no longer be present. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","",reflect,receive,evaluate,mimic,reflect,"Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the Moon’s surface. In this context, ““reflect”” means show or make apparent. The text states that because the surface of the Moon was softer when the Moon was still forming than it is now, early asteroid and meteoroid impacts ““would have left less of an impression”” and, as a result, evidence of them may no longer exist. This context supports the idea that the surface of the Moon may not accurately show signs of early impact events. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that the surface of the Moon may not accurately ““receive,”” or acquire or experience, early impacts from asteroids or meteoroids. The text indicates that the impacts have already occurred, and it isn’t clear how the Moon’s surface could be accurate or inaccurate in experiencing them. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that the surface of the Moon may not accurately ““evaluate,”” or determine the significance or condition of, early impacts from asteroids or meteoroids, since that would suggest that it’s possible for the Moon’s surface to make a decision of any kind. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, ““mimic”” would mean to deliberately simulate or closely imitate something. It wouldn’t make sense to say that the surface of the Moon may not accurately mimic early asteroid and meteoroid impacts, since that would suggest that it’s possible for the Moon to deliberately imitate something.","The sentence explains that the Moon's surface was softer during its formation, meaning early impacts would leave less of an impression, and thus, evidence ""may no longer be present."" The blank needs a word that conveys the idea of showing or accurately representing these past events. ""Reflect"" means to show or be a sign of something, which logically completes the idea that the Moon's surface might not accurately *show* or *represent* the early impact events due to its softer state at the time.","This is the correct answer. ""Reflect"" means to show or embody something. Given that the Moon's surface was softer and impacts left less impression, it logically follows that the surface might not accurately ""reflect"" or show these early events.","This choice is incorrect. ""Receive"" means to acquire or experience something. While the Moon's surface ""received"" impacts, the sentence is discussing its ability to *show* or *preserve* evidence of those impacts, not its ability to initially experience them.","This choice is incorrect. ""Evaluate"" means to assess or determine the significance of something. The Moon's surface is an inanimate object and cannot ""evaluate"" anything. This word implies a cognitive action that is not applicable here.","This choice is incorrect. ""Mimic"" means to imitate or simulate. The Moon's surface is not deliberately imitating early impact events; the discussion is about whether it *retains* or *shows* the signs of those events."
CB-T4-RW1-Q3,CB-T4-RW-M1,Reading Writing,"Craft and Structure","Words in Context",Easy,"Handedness, a preferential use of either the right or left hand, typically is easy to observe in humans. Because this trait is present but less _____ in many other animals, animal-behavior researchers often employ tasks specially designed to reveal individual animals' preferences for a certain hand or paw. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","",recognizable,intriguing,significant,useful,recognizable,"Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion about handedness in animals. As used in this context, “recognizable” means apparent or identifiable. The text indicates that handedness is “easy to observe in humans,” but that animal-behavior researchers use special tasks to determine handedness in other animals. This context and the use of “less” before the blank indicate that compared with handedness in humans, handedness in other animals is less recognizable. Choice B is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that handedness is less “intriguing,” or fascinating, in nonhuman animals than it is in humans. The text focuses on how easy it is to observe handedness in humans as compared with other animals; the text doesn’t suggest that handedness is more fascinating in humans. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that handedness is less “significant,” or important or meaningful, in nonhuman animals than it is in humans. The text focuses on how easy it is to observe handedness in humans as compared with other animals; the text doesn’t suggest that handedness is more significant in humans. Choice D is incorrect because “useful,” or functional or helpful, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text focuses on the ease with which researchers can determine whether an animal or person is right- or left-handed, not on how useful handedness in nonhuman animals is compared with handedness in humans.","The text states that handedness is ""easy to observe in humans"" but ""less _____ in many other animals,"" requiring ""specially designed tasks to reveal"" it. The blank needs a word that contrasts with ""easy to observe."" ""Recognizable"" means easily identified or observed. If it's easy to observe in humans but requires special tasks in other animals, then it's less *recognizable* in those animals. This fits the comparative structure and the need for specialized methods.","This is the correct answer. ""Recognizable"" means able to be identified or observed. The sentence implies that while handedness is easy to see in humans, it's harder to spot in other animals, requiring special methods—thus, it's ""less recognizable.""","This choice is incorrect. ""Intriguing"" means fascinating or captivating. While handedness might be intriguing, the text focuses on the *ease of observation* (or lack thereof) across species, not its inherent fascination.","This choice is incorrect. ""Significant"" means important or meaningful. The text discusses the *observability* of the trait, not its importance or significance, in relation to the use of specialized tasks by researchers.","This choice is incorrect. ""Useful"" means functional or helpful. This word does not fit the context of how easily the trait can be perceived or identified, which is the focus of the comparison between humans and other animals regarding handedness."
