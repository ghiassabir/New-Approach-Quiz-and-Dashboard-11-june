Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",,attached,collected,followed,replaced,collected,"Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft’s contact with the asteroid 101955 Bennu. In this context, “collected” means acquired and took away. The text indicates that although the boulders on the asteroid’s surface caused some unforeseen problems, OSIRIS-REx was able to gather a sample to return to Earth. This context suggests that OSIRIS-REx successfully collected a sample of 101955 Bennu. Choice A is incorrect because in this context “attached” means connected or affixed. The text indicates that OSIRIS-REx gathered pieces of 101955 Bennu to bring to Earth; it doesn’t suggest that the spacecraft attached anything to the asteroid. Choice C is incorrect because in this context “followed” means tracked or traveled behind and the text discusses OSIRIS-REx’s brief encounter with 101955 Bennu during which the spacecraft gathered a sample to bring to Earth. The text doesn’t suggest that the spacecraft tracked the sample, and it’s not clear what it would mean for the spacecraft to travel behind the sample it collected. Choice D is incorrect because in this context “replaced” means put back or returned. The text indicates that OSIRIS-REx gathered pieces of 101955 Bennu to bring to Earth but doesn’t suggest that anything was returned to the asteroid.","The question asks for the most logical and precise word to complete the sentence describing OSIRIS-REx's action. The context states that OSIRIS-REx successfully ""a sample of the surface, gathering pieces of it to bring back to Earth."" The phrase ""gathering pieces of it"" strongly implies the act of obtaining or acquiring something. ""Collected"" perfectly fits this meaning, indicating that the spacecraft successfully acquired the sample.","This choice is incorrect. ""Attached"" means to fasten or join something to something else. The text describes the spacecraft ""gathering pieces of"" the asteroid, not attaching anything to it. This word does not fit the context of acquiring a sample.","This is the correct answer. ""Collected"" means to gather or acquire something, which directly aligns with the phrase ""gathering pieces of it to bring back to Earth."" The spacecraft successfully acquired the sample.","This choice is incorrect. ""Followed"" means to move behind something or to track it. The sentence refers to the spacecraft obtaining a sample, not tracking it. It makes no sense for the spacecraft to ""follow"" a sample it is in the process of gathering.","This choice is incorrect. ""Replaced"" means to put something back in its previous place or to substitute one thing for another. The text clearly states OSIRIS-REx was gathering a sample to bring back, not returning or substituting anything on the asteroid's surface."

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",,reflect,receive,evaluate,mimic,reflect,"Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the Moon’s surface. In this context, “collected” means show or make apparent. The text states that because the surface of the Moon was softer when the Moon was still forming than it is now, early asteroid and meteoroid impacts “would have left less of an impression” and, as a result, evidence of them may no longer exist. This context supports the idea that the surface of the Moon may not accurately show signs of early impact events. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that the surface of the Moon may not accurately “receive,” or acquire or experience, early impacts from asteroids or meteoroids. The text indicates that the impacts have already occurred, and it isn’t clear how the Moon’s surface could be accurate or inaccurate in experiencing them. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that the surface of the Moon may not accurately “evaluate,” or determine the significance or condition of, early impacts from asteroids or meteoroids, since that would suggest that it’s possible for the Moon’s surface to make a decision of any kind. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, “mimic” would mean to deliberately simulate or closely imitate something. It wouldn’t make sense to say that the surface of the Moon may not accurately mimic early asteroid and meteoroid impacts, since that would suggest that it’s possible for the Moon to deliberately imitate something.","The sentence explains that the Moon's surface was softer during its formation, meaning early impacts would leave less of an impression, and thus, evidence ""may no longer be present."" The blank needs a word that conveys the idea of showing or accurately representing these past events. ""Reflect"" means to show or be a sign of something, which logically completes the idea that the Moon's surface might not accurately *show* or *represent* the early impact events due to its softer state at the time.","This is the correct answer. ""Reflect"" means to show or embody something. Given that the Moon's surface was softer and impacts left less impression, it logically follows that the surface might not accurately ""reflect"" or show these early events.","This choice is incorrect.

While the Moon's surface ""received"" impacts, the sentence is discussing its ability to *show* or *preserve* evidence of those impacts, not its ability to initially experience them.","This choice is incorrect. ""Evaluate"" means to assess or determine the significance of something. The Moon's surface is an inanimate object and cannot ""evaluate"" anything.

As used in this context, “recognizable” means apparent or identifiable. The text indicates that handedness is “easy to observe in humans,” but that animal-behavior researchers use special tasks to determine handedness in other animals. This context and the use of “less” before the blank indicate that compared with handedness in humans, handedness in other animals is less recognizable. Choice B is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that handedness is less “intriguing,” or fascinating, in nonhuman animals than it is in humans. The text focuses on how easy it is to observe handedness in humans as compared with other animals; the text doesn’t suggest that handedness is more fascinating in humans. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that handedness is less “significant,” or important or meaningful, in nonhuman animals than it is in humans. The text focuses on how easy it is to observe handedness in humans as compared with other animals; the text doesn’t suggest that handedness is more significant in humans. Choice D is incorrect because “useful,” or functional or helpful, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text focuses on the ease with which researchers can determine whether an animal or person is right- or left-handed, not on how useful handedness in nonhuman animals is compared with handedness in humans.","The text states that handedness is ""easy to observe in humans"" but ""less _____ in many other animals,"" requiring ""specially designed tasks to reveal"" it. The blank needs a word that contrasts with ""easy to observe."" ""Recognizable"" means easily identified or observed.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",,substantial,satisfying,unimportant,appropriate,unimportant,"Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the influences on Banisadr’s work. As used in this context, “unimportant” means trivial or lacking value. “It is by no means” establishes that the word that goes in the blank is contradicted by other information; the material that follows “indeed” later in that sentence provides the contradicting information—namely, that Banisadr himself cites Bosch as an inspiration. In other words, the sentence indicates that Bosch’s influence on Banisadr is significant, and thus recognizing that influence is by no means unimportant. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that recognizing Bosch’s influence on Banisadr isn’t “substantial,” or meaningful. The text states that Banisadr himself cites Bosch as an inspiration. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that it isn’t “satisfying,” or pleasing, to recognize Bosch’s influence on Banisadr. The text states that Banisadr himself cites Bosch as an inspiration. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that recognizing Bosch’s influence on Banisadr isn’t “appropriate,” or suitable.

The following clause, ""indeed, Banisadr himself cites Bosch as an inspiration,"" directly confirms Bosch's influence. Therefore, the blank must be filled with a word that means the opposite of what the subsequent ""indeed"" clause suggests. If Banisadr himself cites Bosch, then recognizing Bosch's influence is clearly *not* unimportant. Thus, ""unimportant"" logically completes the phrase ""It is by no means unimportant,"" meaning it is *definitely* important.","This choice is incorrect.

""Satisfying"" (pleasing or fulfilling) doesn't fit the logical flow. The sentence isn't about whether recognizing the influence is personally satisfying, but rather about the undeniable presence of that influence.","This is the correct answer. The phrase ""It is by no means unimportant"" means ""it is certainly important"" or ""it is definitely not trivial.""

CB-T4-RW1-Q5,CB-T4-RW-M1,Reading Writing,Information and Ideas,Main purpose/idea,Medium,"The following text is adapted from Susan Glaspell's 1912 short story ""Out There."" An elderly shop owner is looking at a picture that he recently acquired and hopes to sell. It did seem that the picture failed to fit in with the rest of the shop. A persuasive young fellow who claimed he was closing out his stock let the old man have it for what he called a song. It was only a little out-of-the-way store which subsisted chiefly on the framing of pictures. The old man looked around at his views of the city, his pictures of cats and dogs, his flaming bits of landscape. ""Don't belong in here,"" he fumed. And yet the old man was secretly proud of his acquisition. There was a hidden dignity in his scowling as he shuffled about pondering the least ridiculous place for the picture. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",,To reveal the shop owner's conflicted feelings about the new picture,To convey the shop owner's resentment of the person he got the new picture from,To describe the items that the shop owner most highly prizes,To explain differences between the new picture and other pictures in the shop,To reveal the shop owner's conflicted feelings about the new picture,"Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text begins by stating that the new picture “failed to fit in” with the other items that the shop owner has. The text goes on to illustrate that point by describing the other pictures the shop owner has, indicating that the shop owner is fuming because he doesn’t think the new picture belongs in the store. In the second paragraph, however, the text indicates that the shop owner is “secretly proud of his acquisition.” The main purpose of the text is thus to reveal the shop owner’s conflicted feelings about the new picture. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the shop owner resents the young man who sold him the new picture; in fact, the text gives no indication of the owner’s feelings about the young man at all. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the new picture is different from the other items in the shop, there’s no suggestion that the shop owner prizes either the new picture or the pictures of the city, pets, and landscapes more than he prizes any items. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe what the new picture looks like; rather, the text identifies some of the other kinds of images that the shop owner has and states that they’re different from the new picture without explaining how they’re different.","The text describes the shop owner's initial reaction to the new picture: ""failed to fit in,"" ""Don't belong in here,"" and his fuming. However, the second paragraph reveals, ""And yet the old man was secretly proud of his acquisition. There was a hidden dignity in his scowling as he shuffled about pondering the least ridiculous place for the picture."" This juxtaposition of external disapproval and internal pride highlights the owner's mixed feelings. Therefore, the main purpose is to show this internal conflict.","This is the correct answer. The text explicitly contrasts the shop owner's outward fuming and feeling that the picture ""failed to fit in"" with his internal ""secretly proud"" feelings and ""hidden dignity"" while pondering its placement. This directly reveals his conflicted feelings.","This choice is incorrect. While the shop owner acquired the picture from a ""persuasive young fellow,"" the text provides no information or suggestion that the shop owner harbors resentment towards this person. The focus is on his feelings about the picture itself.","This choice is incorrect. The text describes other items in the shop (views of the city, cats and dogs, landscapes) to show what the new picture ""failed to fit in"" with.

CB-T4-RW1-Q8,CB-T4-RW-M1,Reading Writing,Craft and Structure,Text structure/purpose,Medium,"The mimosa tree evolved in East Asia, where the beetle Bruchidius terrenus preys on its seeds. In 1785, mimosa trees were introduced to North America, far from any B. terrenus. But evolutionary links between predators and their prey can persist across centuries and continents. Around 2001, B. terrenus was introduced in southeastern North America near where botanist Shu-Mei Chang and colleagues had been monitoring mimosa trees. Within a year, 93 percent of the trees had been attacked by the beetles. Which choice best describes the function of the third sentence in the overall structure of the text?",,It states the hypothesis that Chang and colleagues had set out to investigate using mimosa trees and B. terrenus.,It presents a generalization that is exemplified by the discussion of the mimosa trees and B. terrenus.,It offers an alternative explanation for the findings of Chang and colleagues.,It provides context that clarifies why the species mentioned spread to new locations.,It presents a generalization that is exemplified by the discussion of the mimosa trees and B. terrenus.,"Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the third sentence within the overall structure of the text. The third sentence makes a generalization, asserting that evolutionary links between predators and prey can persist across great expanses of time and distance. This generalization is exemplified by the text’s discussion of the relationship between mimosa trees and B. terrenus beetles. When mimosa trees were introduced to North America in 1785, no B. terrenus beetles were present, so the relationship between the trees and the beetles that exists in their native East Asia was disrupted. When the beetles were introduced to North America more than 200 years later, however, they quickly attacked mimosa trees, illustrating the generalization that links between predators and prey “can persist across centuries and continents.” Choice A is incorrect because the third sentence doesn’t indicate that Chang and colleagues were investigating any particular hypothesis. According to the text, Chang and colleagues were simply monitoring mimosa trees when the beetles happened to be introduced to the area. Choice C is incorrect because the third sentence offers a generalization about the relationship between predators and prey, not an explanation for the findings of Chang and colleagues that differs from an explanation presented elsewhere in the text. Choice D is incorrect because the third sentence doesn’t discuss any particular species (either the species mentioned elsewhere in the text or any other) and doesn’t help explain why species spread to new locations.","The sentence ""But evolutionary links between predators and their prey can persist across centuries and continents"" makes a broad, general statement about ecological relationships. The subsequent sentences then provide a specific historical example: mimosa trees and *B. terrenus* beetles, initially separated by continent and time, show their persisting evolutionary link when *B. terrenus* is introduced to North America, quickly attacking the mimosa trees. Thus, the third sentence sets up a general principle that the rest of the paragraph then illustrates.","This choice is incorrect. The third sentence provides a general principle about predator-prey relationships. It does not state a hypothesis that Chang and colleagues set out to investigate; rather, their monitoring simply observed the re-establishment of a known ecological link.","This is the correct answer. The third sentence presents a broad, overarching claim or principle (""evolutionary links between predators and their prey can persist across centuries and continents""). The subsequent sentences then provide the specific details of the mimosa tree and *B. terrenus* beetle interaction, serving as a concrete example that demonstrates and supports this generalization.","This choice is incorrect. The third sentence offers a generalization that helps explain the observation, but it does not offer an *alternative explanation* to findings by Chang and colleagues. The text does not suggest a prior explanation for their findings.","This choice is incorrect. The third sentence is about the persistence of evolutionary links, not about *why* species spread to new locations. The text simply states that mimosa trees ""were introduced"" and *B. terrenus* ""was introduced,"" without elaborating on the reasons for their spread."
CB-T4-RW1-Q9,CB-T4-RW-M1,Reading Writing,Information and Ideas,Synthesis (connecting multiple texts),Hard,"Text 1: Conventional wisdom long held that human social systems evolved in stages, beginning with hunter-gatherers forming small bands of members with roughly equal status. The shift to agriculture about 12,000 years ago sparked population growth that led to the emergence of groups with hierarchical structures: associations of clans first, then chiefdoms, and finally, bureaucratic states. Text 2: In a 2021 book, anthropologist David Graeber and archaeologist David Wengrow maintain that humans have always been socially flexible, alternately forming systems based on hierarchy and collective ones with decentralized leadership. The authors point to evidence that as far back as 50,000 years ago some hunter-gatherers adjusted their social structures seasonally, at times dispersing in small groups but also assembling into communities that included esteemed individuals. Based on the texts, how would Graeber and Wengrow (Text 2) most likely respond to the ""conventional wisdom"" presented in Text 1?",,By conceding the importance of hierarchical systems but asserting the greater significance of decentralized collective societies,By disputing the idea that developments in social structures have followed a linear progression through distinct stages,By acknowledging that hierarchical roles likely weren't a part of social systems before the rise of agriculture,By challenging the assumption that groupings of hunter-gatherers were among the earliest forms of social structure,By disputing the idea that developments in social structures have followed a linear progression through distinct stages,"Choice B is the best answer because it describes the most likely way that Graeber and Wengrow (Text 2) would respond to the “conventional wisdom” presented in Text 1. According to Text 1, the conventional wisdom about human social systems is that they developed through stages, beginning with hunter-gatherer bands, then moving to clan associations, then chiefdoms, and finally arriving at states with bureaucratic structures. Text 2 indicates that Graeber and Wengrow believe that human social systems have been flexible, shifting between different types of structures, including both hierarchical and collective systems, and that these shifts may have even occurred seasonally. This suggests that Graeber and Wengrow would dispute the idea that developments in social structures have followed a linear progression through distinct stages. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that Graeber and Wengrow believe that decentralized collective societies are more significant than hierarchical systems. Text 2 is focused on Graeber and Wengrow’s view that humans have flexibly shifted among various social structures, not on the importance of particular structures relative to others. Choice C is incorrect because Text 2 doesn’t include any information suggesting that Graeber and Wengrow believe that hierarchies didn’t emerge until after the rise of agriculture. In fact, Text 2 indicates that Graeber and Wengrow cite evidence suggesting that some hunter-gatherer groups formed social structures with hierarchical elements (“communities that included esteemed individuals”) 50,000 years ago, long before the rise of agriculture, which Text 1 says occurred around 12,000 years ago. Choice D is incorrect because there’s no information in Text 2 suggesting that Graeber and Wengrow would challenge the assumption that groupings of hunter-gatherers were among the earliest forms of social structure. Although Text 1 does indicate that hunter-gatherer groups are assumed to be the earliest human social system, Text 2 says only that Graeber and Wengrow believe that some hunter-gatherer groups made use of different social structures at different times. Text 2 doesn’t imply that Graeber and Wengrow doubt that hunter-gatherer groups preceded most other social structures.","Text 1 describes ""conventional wisdom"" as social systems evolving in a ""linear progression through distinct stages"" (hunter-gatherers -> clans -> chiefdoms -> states). Text 2, by Graeber and Wengrow, directly challenges this by stating humans have ""always been socially flexible, alternately forming systems based on hierarchy and collective ones"" and provides evidence of hunter-gatherers having hierarchical elements 50,000 years ago. This directly refutes the idea of a fixed, linear progression.","This choice is incorrect. Text 2 focuses on the *flexibility* of human social structures, not asserting the ""greater significance"" of decentralized societies over hierarchical ones. It suggests both types existed at various times.","This is the correct answer. Text 1 describes a ""linear progression through distinct stages"" of social evolution. Text 2 directly contrasts this by arguing that humans have ""always been socially flexible, alternately forming systems based on hierarchy and collective ones"" and provides evidence that undermines a rigid, stage-based view.","This choice is incorrect. Text 2 explicitly states that some hunter-gatherer groups, dating back 50,000 years (long before agriculture), ""included esteemed individuals,"" which implies the presence of hierarchical elements. Thus, they would acknowledge, not deny, that hierarchical roles existed early.","This choice is incorrect. While Text 2 presents an alternative view of social flexibility, it does not challenge the assumption that hunter-gatherer groupings were *among the earliest forms* of social structure.

The text describes Mary’s activities in an overgrown hidden garden, saying that she was “very much absorbed” and was “only becoming more pleased with her work every hour” rather than getting tired of it. She also thinks of garden activities as a “fascinating sort of play.” Thus, the main idea of the text is that Mary feels very satisfied when taking care of the garden. Choice A is incorrect because the text never makes any mention of Mary’s chores. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that Mary finds pulling up weeds to be fascinating, not boring. Choice C is incorrect because Mary thinks of garden activities in and of themselves as play, not as something necessary to do to create a space to play.","The text describes Mary's engagement with the garden: she was ""very much absorbed,"" ""only becoming more pleased with her work every hour instead of tiring of it,"" and considered it a ""fascinating sort of play.""

Based on the text, in what way is the human mind like a flower?",,It becomes increasingly vigorous with the passage of time.,It draws strength from changes in the weather.,It requires proper nourishment in order to thrive.,It perseveres despite challenging circumstances.,It requires proper nourishment in order to thrive.,"Choice C is the best answer because it presents a description of how the human mind is like a flower that is directly supported by the text. The text compares the needs of a “fragile and lovely flower” to those of the speaker’s “tender mind”: both need to be fed if they’re going to survive. Without such feeding, they’ll “beginneth straightway to languish,” or weaken. Thus, the text suggests that the human mind is like a flower in that they both need proper nourishment in order to thrive. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t address the passage of time or describe either the human mind or a flower as becoming increasingly vigorous. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that human minds or flowers draw strength from changes in weather. The references to rain in the text pertain to a flower’s need for water rather than the general effects of changing weather. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the human mind or a flower will persist regardless of challenging circumstances. In fact, the text indicates that they’ll both languish right away if not given what they need.","The poem uses a direct analogy: ""As a fragile and lovely flower...if the dew and the rain draw it forth; / So doth my tender mind flourish, if it be fed with the sweet dew of the fostering spirit, / Lacking this, it beginneth straightway to languish."" The comparison is explicit: both the flower and the mind need proper ""feeding"" or ""fostering"" (nourishment) to ""flourish"" (thrive) and will ""languish"" (wither) without it.","This choice is incorrect. The text describes the immediate need for nourishment for both the flower and the mind to flourish, not a gradual process of becoming more vigorous over time. In fact, it says they ""languish straightway"" without nourishment.","This choice is incorrect. The ""dew and rain"" are mentioned as nourishment for the flower, not as ""changes in the weather"" that provide strength. The analogy is about constant provision, not adaptation to variable weather.","This is the correct answer. The poem explicitly states that just as a flower needs ""dew and rain"" to ""unfold"" and ""flourish,"" the human mind needs to be ""fed with the sweet dew of the fostering spirit"" to ""flourish.""

When Thornton's partners, Hans and Pete, arrived on the long-expected raft, Buck refused to notice them till he learned they were close to Thornton; after that he tolerated them in a passive sort of way, accepting favors from them as though he favored them by accepting. Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",,Buck has become less social since he began living with Thornton.,Buck mistrusts humans and does his best to avoid them.,Buck has been especially well liked by most of Thornton's friends.,Buck holds Thornton in higher regard than any other person.,Buck holds Thornton in higher regard than any other person.,"Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. After establishing that Buck views most people “as nothing,” the text explains that Buck won’t acknowledge people other than Thornton unless they appear friendly toward Thornton, and even then he’s only reluctantly accepting. Thus, the text focuses on the idea that Thornton has a special status in Buck’s mind, with Buck holding him in higher regard than other people. Choice A is incorrect because the text conveys that Buck isn’t social with people other than Thornton but doesn’t address Buck’s life or temperament before he lived with Thornton. Choice B is incorrect because the text conveys that Buck doesn’t really care about people other than Thornton and is aloof toward them.

The graph shows the number of organic farms located in each of six US states in 2016: between 2,600 and 2,800 in California; between 1,200 and 1,400 in Wisconsin; between 1,000 and 1,200 in New York; approximately 800 in Pennsylvania; and between 600 and 800 in both Iowa and Washington. The last sentence of the text provides information about the number of organic farms in 2016, first describing the number in California. The best completion of the sentence is the choice that accurately describes the number of organic farms in 2016 in another state, which the assertion that Washington had between 600 and 800 organic farms provides. Choice B is incorrect because it doesn’t accurately reflect the data from the graph. The graph indicates that there were between 1,000 and 1,200 organic farms in New York, not fewer than 800 organic farms. Choice C is incorrect because it doesn’t accurately reflect the data from the graph. While the graph indicates that there were between 1,200 and 1,400 organic farms in Wisconsin in 2016, there were only between 600 and 800 in Iowa.

The researchers found that, due to slight differences in feather shape, the feathers of migratory forked-tailed flycatcher males make a sound during flight that is higher pitched than that made by the feathers of nonmigratory males. The researchers hypothesize that fork-tailed flycatcher females are attracted to the specific sound made by the males of their own subspecies, and that over time the females' preference will drive further genetic and anatomical divergence between the subspecies. Which finding, if true, would most directly support Gómez-Bahamón and her team's hypothesis?",,"The feathers located on the wings of the migratory fork-tailed flycatchers have a narrower shape than those of the nonmigratory birds, which allows them to fly long distances.","Over several generations, the sound made by the feathers of migratory male fork-tailed flycatchers grows progressively higher pitched relative to that made by the feathers of nonmigratory males.",Fork-tailed flycatchers communicate different messages to each other depending on whether their feathers create high-pitched or low-pitched sounds.,The breeding habits of the migratory and nonmigratory fork-tailed flycatchers remained generally the same over several generations.,"Over several generations, the sound made by the feathers of migratory male fork-tailed flycatchers grows progressively higher pitched relative to that made by the feathers of nonmigratory males.","Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support Gómez-Bahamón and her team’s hypothesis about fork-tailed flycatchers. The text indicates that although two subspecies of the birds live in the same region, the tail feathers of the migrating males make a higher-pitched sound than the tail feathers of the nonmigrating males do. Gómez-Bahamón and her team hypothesize that female fork-tailed flycatchers are attracted to the particular sound made by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will bring about additional “genetic and anatomical divergence” between the two subspecies. If it were found that the pitch generated by the tail feathers of migrating males is getting higher over successive generations, it would indicate that the shape of the migrating subspecies’ tail feathers is diverging further from that of the nonmigrating subspecies. And if females continue to prefer the sounds of the males of their own subspecies, the females of the migrating subspecies will become acclimated to increasingly higher pitches over subsequent generations, causing further divergence between the subspecies. Thus, if it were found that migrating males’ tail feathers were producing higher pitches over time, that would support the researchers’ hypothesis. Choice A is incorrect because the researchers’ hypothesis is that female flycatchers prefer the sounds produced by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will lead to further divergence between the two subspecies. This finding is about the shape of wing feathers and how that affects long-distance flight, whereas the hypothesis is about the shape of tail feathers and how that relates to female mate preference. Choice C is incorrect because the researchers’ hypothesis is that female flycatchers prefer the sounds produced by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will lead to further divergence between the two subspecies. This finding focuses on how the tail feather sounds communicate different messages, which doesn’t address differences between the subspecies or female preferences. Choice D is incorrect because the researchers’ hypothesis is that female flycatchers prefer the sounds produced by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will lead to further divergence between the two subspecies. The finding that breeding habits haven’t changed for either subspecies does not, by itself, suggest anything about female preferences or divergence between the two subspecies.","The hypothesis is that ""female fork-tailed flycatchers are attracted to the specific sound made by the males of their own subspecies, and that over time the females' preference will drive further genetic and anatomical divergence between the subspecies."" To support this, we need evidence of *increasing divergence* in the male sound that attracts the females. If the migratory males' feather sounds are progressively getting higher pitched *relative to the nonmigratory males* over generations, this shows ongoing anatomical change linked to the sound, which would be driven by the female preference, thus confirming the divergence predicted by the hypothesis.","This choice is incorrect. This finding describes a feather characteristic that allows for long-distance flight. While it's a difference between subspecies, it doesn't directly support the hypothesis that *female preference for sound* drives *genetic and anatomical divergence related to that sound*.","This is the correct answer. The hypothesis states that female preference for specific male sounds will lead to ""further genetic and anatomical divergence."" If the sound itself (which is linked to feather shape, an anatomical feature) is becoming progressively higher pitched over generations, it directly shows an ongoing anatomical change in males, likely driven by the hypothesized female preference, thus supporting the divergence aspect of the hypothesis.","This choice is incorrect. This finding suggests different communication methods but doesn't explain *why* divergence would occur or how female preference for a *specific* sound within a subspecies leads to further separation between subspecies. It describes existing communication, not an evolutionary driver of divergence.","This choice is incorrect.

Earth's atmosphere is bombarded by cosmic dust originating from several sources: short-period comets (SPCs), particles from the asteroid belt (ASTs), Halley-type comets (HTCs), and Oort cloud comets (OCCs). Some of the dust's material vaporizes in the atmosphere in a process called ablation, and the faster the particles move, the higher the rate of ablation. Astrophysicist Juan Diego Carrillo-Sánchez led a team that calculated average ablation rates for elements in the dust (such as iron and potassium) and showed that material in slower-moving SPC or AST dust has a lower rate than the same material in faster-moving HTC or OCC dust. For example, whereas the average ablation rate for iron from AST dust is 28%, the average rate for _____.

The table shows the ablation rates for three elements—iron, potassium, and sodium—found in cosmic dust that comes from one of four sources. The text says that the ablation rate for a given element in slower-moving SPC or AST dust was lower than the ablation rate for that same element in faster-moving HTC or OCC dust. The text then presents the first part of an example of this pattern, describing an ablation rate of 28% for iron in AST dust. The information that iron from HTC dust had an ablation rate of 90% is therefore the most effective way to complete this example—the comparison of a relatively low ablation rate for iron in slower-moving AST dust with a relatively high ablation rate for iron in faster-moving HTC dust illustrates the tendency of ablation rates for a given element to be lower in slower-moving dust than in faster-moving dust. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that SPC dust, like AST dust, moves relatively slowly; a comparison of the ablation rates of iron from two slower-moving dust sources could not be an example of the difference between ablation rates in slower-moving dust and faster-moving dust, which is the pattern that the example is supposed to illustrate. Choice B is incorrect because the example in the text is supposed to illustrate the difference in the ablation rates of the same element from slower-moving dust and faster-moving dust, and the first part of the example provides data about the ablation rate of iron, which means the second part of the example must also be about the ablation rate of iron, not the ablation rate of sodium. Choice D is incorrect because the example in the text is supposed to illustrate the difference in the ablation rates of the same element from slower-moving dust and faster-moving dust, and the first part of the example provides data about the ablation rate of iron, which means the second part of the example must also be about the ablation rate of iron, not the ablation rate of sodium. Additionally, any ablation rate from AST dust would be ineffective in this example since AST dust is referenced in the first part of the example and thus additional data focused on AST dust would not illustrate a variation across dust types.","The text states a pattern: ""material in slower-moving SPC or AST dust has a lower rate than the same material in faster-moving HTC or OCC dust."" The example starts with ""iron from AST dust is 28%."" AST dust is ""slower-moving."" To complete the example following the pattern, we need the ablation rate for *iron* from a *faster-moving* dust source (HTC or OCC). Looking at the table, iron from HTC dust is 90%.

The text explains that mycorrhizal hosts are plants that benefit from the presence of mycorrhizal fungi in the soil and that some such plants produce more mass when grown in the presence of these fungi, while for nonmycorrhizal species the fungi either have no effect or may be harmful. The experiment included two mycorrhizal hosts (corn and marigold) and one nonmycorrhizal species (broccoli). Given the claim in the text that nonmycorrhizal species will see either no difference or a decrease in mass when exposed to mycorrhizal fungi, the student would likely have been surprised by the higher average mass for broccoli grown in the presence of the fungi than the broccoli grown in the soil treated to kill fungi. Choice B is incorrect. Although this choice accurately describes the corn data from the table, the fact that the mycorrhizal host corn is more massive in the presence of the fungi likely fits with what the student expected and would therefore not be surprising. Choice C is incorrect. Although this choice accurately describes the marigold data from the table, the fact that the mycorrhizal host marigold is more massive in the presence of the fungi is likely what the student expected and thus would not be surprising. Choice D is incorrect because it does not accurately represent the data in the table—when grown in soil treated to kill fungi, corn had an average mass of 3.8 g while broccoli had an average mass of 7g—and because making comparisons among the plants in the no-fungi condition, by itself, does not provide a basis to compare the average mass of mycorrhizal hosts and nonmycorrhizal species grown in the presence of the fungi with those grown in the soil treated to kill fungi.","The passage states that nonmycorrhizal species (like broccoli) either ""have no effect or may be harmful"" from fungi, so the student would be ""surprised"" if broccoli in soil with fungi had a *higher* mass than broccoli in soil where fungi were killed.
