EOC-M-C1-AlgebraBasics-Q1,EOC-M-C1-AlgebraBasics,Math,Algebra,Linear equations in 1 variable,Easy,"If 5x - 7 = 28, what is the value of x?","",5,7,9,35,7,"Add 7 to both sides of the equation to get 5x = 35. Then divide both sides by 5 to find x.","This is a two-step linear equation. The goal is to isolate the variable 'x'. First, eliminate the constant on the left side by adding 7 to both sides: 5x - 7 + 7 = 28 + 7, which simplifies to 5x = 35. Next, divide both sides by the coefficient of x, which is 5. This gives x = 35 / 5, so x = 7.","This is the result of dividing 28 by 5 before adding 7. The order of operations requires isolating the term with x first.","This is the correct answer. Adding 7 to 28 gives 35, and 35 divided by 5 is 7.","This answer may result from adding 7 and 5 and then subtracting from 28. Remember to follow the correct algebraic steps.","This is the value of 5x, not x. You completed the first step (addition) but missed the second step (division)."
EOC-M-C1-AlgebraBasics-Q2,EOC-M-C1-AlgebraBasics,Math,Algebra,Linear inequalities,Medium,"Which of the following numbers is a solution to the inequality 3(y - 2) < 15?","",-2,7,8,10,-2,"Distribute the 3 to get 3y - 6 < 15. Add 6 to both sides to get 3y < 21. Divide by 3 to get y < 7. Of the choices, only -2 is less than 7.","To solve the inequality, first use the distributive property on the left side: 3 * y - 3 * 2 < 15, which simplifies to 3y - 6 < 15. Next, add 6 to both sides to isolate the term with y: 3y < 21. Finally, divide by 3: y < 7. The inequality is true for any number less than 7. We must check which of the given options satisfies this condition.","This is a correct answer because -2 is less than 7.","This value is not a solution. If y = 7, the inequality would be 7 < 7, which is false. The solution must be strictly less than 7.","This value is not a solution because 8 is not less than 7.","This value is not a solution because 10 is not less than 7."
EOC-M-C1-AlgebraBasics-Q3,EOC-M-C1-AlgebraBasics,Math,Algebra,Systems of linear equations,Medium,"Given the system of equations below, what is the value of y? \n2x + 3y = 12\nx - 3y = -3","",1,2,3,5,2,"To solve for y, use elimination. Add the two equations: (2x + 3y) + (x - 3y) = 12 + (-3). This simplifies to 3x = 9, so x = 3. Substitute x back into the second equation: (3) - 3y = -3. Subtract 3 to get -3y = -6. Divide by -3 to find y = 2.","This question tests solving a system of linear equations. The elimination method is efficient here. By adding the two equations vertically, the 'y' terms cancel out: (2x+3y) + (x-3y) = 12 + (-3), which results in 3x = 9. Solving for x gives x=3. Now, substitute x=3 into either original equation. Using the second one: (3) - 3y = -3. Subtract 3 from both sides: -3y = -6. Finally, divide by -3 to get y=2.","This choice is incorrect. It may result from a calculation error after finding the correct value for x.","This is the correct answer. Solving the system of equations yields x=3 and y=2.","This is the value of x, not y. Be sure to answer the specific question asked.","This value may result from adding 12 and -3 and then making another error. It does not solve the system."
EOC-M-C1-AlgebraBasics-Q4,EOC-M-C1-AlgebraBasics,Math,Algebra,Interpreting linear functions,Hard,"A company's profit P, in thousands of dollars, is modeled by the function P(m) = 15m + 45, where m is the number of months since the company started. Which statement is the best interpretation of the number 15 in this context?","","The company's initial profit was $15,000.","The company's profit increases by $15,000 each month.","The company reaches a profit of $15,000 after a certain number of months.","The company's profit increases by $45,000 each month.",The company's profit increases by $15,000 each month.,"The function is in the form y = mx + b, where m is the slope (rate of change) and b is the y-intercept (initial value). The number 15 is the slope.","This question asks to interpret a linear function, P(m) = 15m + 45, which is in the slope-intercept form y = mx + b. In this form, 'm' represents the slope or rate of change, and 'b' represents the y-intercept or initial value. Here, m=15 and b=45. The slope, 15, represents the change in profit for each one-unit change in months. Since P is in thousands of dollars, 15 represents a $15,000 increase in profit per month. The y-intercept, 45, represents the initial profit at m=0, which is $45,000.","This statement describes the y-intercept (b), not the slope (m). The initial profit is $45,000.","This is the correct answer, as 15 is the slope of the line, which represents the rate of change of profit per month.","This is an incorrect interpretation of the slope. The slope tells us how much the profit changes per month, not a target profit value.","This statement confuses the slope (15) with the y-intercept (45). The rate of change is $15,000 per month."
EOC-M-C1-AlgebraBasics-Q5,EOC-M-C1-AlgebraBasics,Math,Algebra,Linear equations in 2 variables,Medium,"The graph of a line in the xy-plane passes through the points (1, 5) and (3, 9). What is the equation of the line?","",y = 2x + 3,y = 2x - 1,y = x + 4,y = 4x + 1,y = 2x + 3,"First, find the slope (m) = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (9-5)/(3-1) = 4/2 = 2. Then use point-slope form y - y1 = m(x - x1). Using point (1,5): y - 5 = 2(x - 1) => y - 5 = 2x - 2 => y = 2x + 3.","To find the equation of a line, we first need its slope. The slope 'm' is the change in y divided by the change in x: m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1). Using the given points, m = (9 - 5) / (3 - 1) = 4 / 2 = 2. Now we can use the slope-intercept form, y = mx + b, and one of the points to solve for b. Using (1, 5): 5 = 2(1) + b => 5 = 2 + b => b = 3. Therefore, the equation is y = 2x + 3.","This is the correct answer. The slope is 2 and the y-intercept is 3, which matches the calculations.","This equation has the correct slope, but the y-intercept is incorrect. This would be the equation for a line passing through (1, 1) and (3, 5), for example.","This equation has an incorrect slope. A slope of 1 would mean the y-value increases by 1 for every 1-unit increase in x.","This equation has an incorrect slope. A slope of 4 would mean the y-value increases by 4 for every 1-unit increase in x."

What is the volume of the prism?","",15 cm³,24 cm³,120 cm³,150 cm³,120 cm³,"The volume of a rectangular prism is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height. V = l * w * h.","The formula for the volume (V) of a rectangular prism is V = length × width × height. Given the dimensions length = 6 cm, width = 4 cm, and height = 5 cm, you can substitute these values into the formula: V = 6 * 4 * 5. First, multiply 6 by 4 to get 24. Then, multiply 24 by 5 to get 120. The volume is 120 cubic centimeters.","This answer may result from adding the dimensions instead of multiplying them (6+4+5=15).","This answer is the result of multiplying length and width (6*4=24), but forgetting to multiply by the height.","This is the correct answer, calculated as 6 * 4 * 5.","This answer is incorrect. It may be a simple multiplication error (e.g., 6*5*5)."

Line j must also have a slope of -3.","Parallel lines in the xy-plane always have identical slopes. The equation for line k is given in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b), where 'm' is the slope. In the equation y = -3x + 5, the slope is -3. For line j to be parallel to line k, it must also have a slope of -3. The y-intercept can be different. We need to find the option with a slope of -3.","This equation has a slope of 3. This is the negative reciprocal of the original slope and would be perpendicular, not parallel.","This equation has a slope of 1/3, which is the negative reciprocal of -3. A line with this slope would be perpendicular to line k.","This is the correct answer. It has the same slope of -3 as line k, but a different y-intercept, which means it's a different but parallel line.","This equation has a slope of 5, which is not equal to -3."

Substitute h=2, k=-3, and r=4.","The standard form for the equation of a circle is (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r², where (h, k) are the coordinates of the center and r is the radius. In this problem, we are given the center (h, k) = (2, -3) and the radius r = 4. We substitute these values into the formula: (x - 2)² + (y - (-3))² = 4². This simplifies to (x - 2)² + (y + 3)² = 16.","This is the correct equation for the circle with the given center and radius.","This equation incorrectly flips the signs of h and k in the formula and uses r instead of r².","This equation uses the correct center coordinates but uses r instead of r² for the right side of the equation.","This equation incorrectly flips the signs of the center coordinates (h, k)."

Angles A and B are complementary, so sin(A) = cos(B).","This question relies on the co-function identity for sine and cosine. In any right triangle, the two acute angles are complementary, meaning their sum is 90 degrees. For complementary angles A and B, it is always true that sin(A) = cos(B) and cos(A) = sin(B). Since the problem states that sin(A) = 8/17, the value of cos(B) must be the same.","This would be the value of cos(A). The adjacent side would be 15 (from Pythagorean theorem: 17² - 8² = 225, sqrt(225)=15), so cos(A) = adjacent/hypotenuse = 15/17.","This would be the value of tan(A) or cot(B).","This is the reciprocal of sin(A), which would be csc(A).","This is the correct answer because angles A and B are the two acute angles in a right triangle, making them complementary. Therefore, sin(A) = cos(B)."
EOC-M-C2-Geometry-Q5,EOC-M-C2-Geometry,Math,"Geometry and Trigonometry",Area and volume,Hard,"A cylinder has a volume of 128π cubic inches and a height of 8 inches. What is the radius of the cylinder's base?","",2 inches,4 inches,8 inches,16 inches,4 inches,"The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr²h. We are given V = 128π and h = 8. So, 128π = πr²(8). Divide both sides by 8π to get 16 = r². Take the square root of both sides to find r = 4.","To solve this, we start with the formula for the volume of a cylinder: V = πr²h. We are given the volume V = 128π and the height h = 8. We can plug these values into the formula: 128π = π * r² * 8. Our goal is to solve for the radius, r. First, we can divide both sides of the equation by π to get 128 = 8r². Next, divide both sides by 8 to isolate r²: 128 / 8 = r², which simplifies to 16 = r². Finally, take the square root of both sides to find r: √16 = r, so r = 4.","This answer is incorrect. It may result from a miscalculation after finding r² = 16.","This is the correct answer. When 128π is divided by 8π, the result is 16. The square root of 16 is 4.","This value is the height, not the radius. Be careful not to mix up the variables.","This value is r², not r. You correctly isolated r² but forgot to take the square root."
