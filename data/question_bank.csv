Eliminate Choices B and C because they are conjugated verbs. “Effect"" is rarely used as a verb, but when it is, it means to bring about. ""Affect"" means to influence. The sentence is much more logical with influence, so ""affect” is the correct answer.","The sentence uses the modal verb 'can,' which must be followed by the base form of a verb. This eliminates 'effects' and 'affects.' The choice is between 'effect' and 'affect.' 'Affect' is a verb meaning 'to influence or have an impact on.' 'Effect' is most commonly a noun meaning 'a result.' In this context, the meaning is 'to influence' the demeanor, so 'affect' is the correct choice.","This is incorrect. 'Effect' is primarily a noun. While it can be a verb meaning 'to bring about,' 'affect' (to influence) is the more logical and common choice here.","This is incorrect. This is a noun meaning 'results,' not a verb.","This is incorrect. This is the third-person singular form of the verb, but a modal verb like 'can' must be followed by the base form.",This is the correct answer. 'Affect' is the correct base form of the verb meaning 'to influence'.

The part that follows is a list of things the imagination does ('consider what it would have been like... or to form a picture...'). A colon is the correct punctuation mark to introduce a list or explanation that clarifies the preceding clause.",This choice creates a grammatically awkward structure and is less clear than using a colon.,This is the correct answer. A colon is used appropriately to introduce an explanation or list that clarifies what is meant by 'stimulates the imagination'.,"This is incorrect. A semicolon is used to connect two independent clauses, but the phrase following the punctuation is not an independent clause.","This choice incorrectly uses a comma to attach a list, which can be confusing, and also omits a necessary comma in the list itself."

In this case, the subject is ""trend,” which is a singular noun that will require a corresponding verb. Eliminate Choices B and D for being plural verbs. Choice C incorrectly uses future perfect tense, whereas present is the desired tense. “There has been a trend” is the best answer.","In the structure 'there + verb,' the true subject follows the verb. The subject here is 'a trend,' which is singular. Therefore, the verb must also be singular. 'has been' is the singular present perfect form and fits the context of a trend that has existed across past travels.",This is the correct answer. The singular verb 'has been' correctly agrees with the singular subject 'a trend'.,This is incorrect. 'have been' is a plural verb.,"This is incorrect. 'will have been' is future tense, but the travel and the trend are in the past and present.",This is incorrect. 'be' is an infinitive/subjunctive form and does not create a grammatically complete sentence here.
