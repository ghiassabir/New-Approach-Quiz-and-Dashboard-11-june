Line <i>j</i> is perpendicular to line <i>k</i> in the xy-plane. What is the slope of line <i>j</i>?,,,,,,".1764, .1765, 3/17","The correct answer is 3/17. It's given that line j is perpendicular to line k in the xy-plane. This means that the slope of line j is the negative reciprocal of the slope of line k. The equation of line k, y = (-17/3)x + 5, is written in slope-intercept form y = mx + b, where m is the slope of the line and b is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept of the line. It follows that the slope of line k is -17/3. The negative reciprocal of a number is -1 divided by the number. Therefore, the negative reciprocal of -17/3 is -1/(-17/3), or 3/17. Thus, the slope of line j is 3/17. Note that 3/17, .1764, .1765, and 0.176 are examples of ways to enter a correct answer.","1.  **Identify the slope of line k.** The equation for line k is given in slope-intercept form, y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope. For the equation y = (-17/3)x + 5, the slope of line k is -17/3.<br>2.  **Understand perpendicular slopes.** The slopes of two perpendicular lines are negative reciprocals of each other. This means if one slope is 'm', the perpendicular slope is '-1/m'.<br>3.  **Calculate the negative reciprocal.** We need to find the negative reciprocal of -17/3.<br>   - First, find the reciprocal by flipping the fraction: 3/(-17) or -3/17.<br>   - Then, take the negative of that reciprocal: -(-3/17) = 3/17.<br>Therefore, the slope of line j is 3/17.

It's given that Cameron drove 60 miles per hour for x hours; therefore, the distance driven at this speed can be represented by 60x. He then drove 50 miles per hour for y hours; therefore, the distance driven at this speed can be represented by 50y. Since Cameron drove 210 total miles, the equation 60x + 50y = 210 represents this situation. If x = 1, substitution yields 60(1) + 50y = 210, or 60 + 50y = 210.

Similarly, the same adult uses 150b calories after bicycling for b 30-minute periods. Therefore, the equation 200h + 150b = 1,900 represents the situation. It's given that the adult completes 1 hour, or 2 30-minute periods, of bicycling. Substituting 2 for b yields 200h + 150(2) = 1,900, or 200h + 300 = 1,900. Subtracting 300 from both sides gives 200h = 1,600. Dividing by 200 yields h = 8.
