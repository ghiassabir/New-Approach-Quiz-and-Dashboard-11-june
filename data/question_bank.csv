So the side lengths can be expressed as $x, \sqrt{3}x, \text{and } 2x$... The hypotenuse of 8 equals $2x$, and the shortest side equals $x$. Do the calculations to find the length of the shortest side: $8 = 2x \rightarrow x = 4$. Alternatively, you can just recognize that ratio of the smallest side to the hypotenuse in a 30-60-90 triangle is 1:2. So the value of the smallest side... is 4.","In a 30-60-90 right triangle, the side lengths have a specific ratio. The side opposite the $30^\circ$ angle is the shortest side ($x$), the side opposite the $60^\circ$ angle is $x\sqrt{3}$, and the hypotenuse (opposite the $90^\circ$ angle) is $2x$. Given the hypotenuse is 8, we have $2x = 8$. Solving for $x$, we get $x=4$. The smallest side is $x$, so its value is 4.",,,,

A constant current of 1 kilometer per hour makes his trip downstream faster than his trip upstream because he is moving with the current downstream and fighting against the current when traveling upstream.

Use the quadratic formula... You get two solutions. However, you can use only $4+\sqrt{17}$, because velocity cannot be negative.

Downstream time: $t_{down} = \frac{16}{r+1}$. Total time is 4 hours: $\frac{16}{r-1} + \frac{16}{r+1} = 4$. Divide by 4: $\frac{4}{r-1} + \frac{4}{r+1} = 1$. Multiply by $(r-1)(r+1)$ to clear denominators: $4(r+1) + 4(r-1) = (r-1)(r+1)$. This simplifies to $8r = r^2 - 1$, or $r^2 - 8r - 1 = 0$. Using the quadratic formula, $r = \frac{8 \pm \sqrt{64 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2} = \frac{8 \pm \sqrt{68}}{2}$. Since rate must be positive, $r = \frac{8 + \sqrt{68}}{2} \approx \frac{8 + 8.246}{2} \approx 8.123$.",This answer may be the result of a calculation error when solving the rational or quadratic equation.,"This is the correct answer, derived from setting up the time equations and solving the resulting quadratic equation.",This answer may be the result of a calculation error when solving the rational or quadratic equation.,This answer may be the result of a calculation error when solving the rational or quadratic equation.
