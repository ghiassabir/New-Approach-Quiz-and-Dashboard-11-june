EOC-M-C2-Geometry-Q1	EOC-M-C2-Geometry	Math	Geometry and Trigonometry	Area and volume	Easy	A rectangular prism has a length of 6 cm, a width of 4 cm, and a height of 5 cm. What is the volume of the prism?		15 cm³	24 cm³	120 cm³	150 cm³	120 cm³	The volume of a rectangular prism is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height. V = l * w * h.	The formula for the volume (V) of a rectangular prism is V = length × width × height. Given the dimensions length = 6 cm, width = 4 cm, and height = 5 cm, you can substitute these values into the formula: V = 6 * 4 * 5. First, multiply 6 by 4 to get 24. Then, multiply 24 by 5 to get 120. The volume is 120 cubic centimeters.	This answer may result from adding the dimensions instead of multiplying them (6+4+5=15).	This answer is the result of multiplying length and width (6*4=24), but forgetting to multiply by the height.	This is the correct answer, calculated as 6 * 4 * 5.	This answer is incorrect. It may be a simple multiplication error (e.g., 6*5*5).
EOC-M-C2-Geometry-Q2	EOC-M-C2-Geometry	Math	Geometry and Trigonometry	Lines, angles, and triangles	Medium	In the xy-plane, line k is parallel to line j. Line k has the equation y = -3x + 5. Which of the following could be the equation for line j?		y = 3x + 5	y = (1/3)x - 2	y = -3x - 2	y = 5x - 3	y = -3x - 2	Parallel lines have the same slope. The slope of line k is -3. Line j must also have a slope of -3.	Parallel lines in the xy-plane always have identical slopes. The equation for line k is given in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b), where 'm' is the slope. In the equation y = -3x + 5, the slope is -3. For line j to be parallel to line k, it must also have a slope of -3. The y-intercept can be different. We need to find the option with a slope of -3.	This equation has a slope of 3. This is the negative reciprocal of the original slope and would be perpendicular, not parallel.	This equation has a slope of 1/3, which is the negative reciprocal of -3. A line with this slope would be perpendicular to line k.	This is the correct answer. It has the same slope of -3 as line k, but a different y-intercept, which means it's a different but parallel line.	This equation has a slope of 5, which is not equal to -3.
EOC-M-C2-Geometry-Q3	EOC-M-C2-Geometry	Math	Geometry and Trigonometry	Circles	Hard	A circle in the xy-plane has its center at (2, -3) and a radius of 4. Which of the following is the equation of the circle?		(x - 2)² + (y + 3)² = 16	(x + 2)² + (y - 3)² = 4	(x - 2)² + (y + 3)² = 4	(x + 2)² + (y - 3)² = 16	(x - 2)² + (y + 3)² = 16	The standard equation of a circle is (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r², where (h, k) is the center and r is the radius. Substitute h=2, k=-3, and r=4.	The standard form for the equation of a circle is (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r², where (h, k) are the coordinates of the center and r is the radius. In this problem, we are given the center (h, k) = (2, -3) and the radius r = 4. We substitute these values into the formula: (x - 2)² + (y - (-3))² = 4². This simplifies to (x - 2)² + (y + 3)² = 16.	This is the correct equation for the circle with the given center and radius.	This equation incorrectly flips the signs of h and k in the formula and uses r instead of r².	This equation uses the correct center coordinates but uses r instead of r² for the right side of the equation.	This equation incorrectly flips the signs of the center coordinates (h, k).
EOC-M-C2-Geometry-Q4	EOC-M-C2-Geometry	Math	Geometry and Trigonometry	Right triangle trigonometry	Medium	In a right triangle ABC, the right angle is at C. If sin(A) = 8/17, what is the value of cos(B)?		15/17	8/15	17/8	8/17	8/17	In a right triangle, the sine of one acute angle is equal to the cosine of its complementary angle. Angles A and B are complementary, so sin(A) = cos(B).	This question relies on the co-function identity for sine and cosine. In any right triangle, the two acute angles are complementary, meaning their sum is 90 degrees. For complementary angles A and B, it is always true that sin(A) = cos(B) and cos(A) = sin(B). Since the problem states that sin(A) = 8/17, the value of cos(B) must be the same.	This would be the value of cos(A). The adjacent side would be 15 (from Pythagorean theorem: 17² - 8² = 225, sqrt(225)=15), so cos(A) = adjacent/hypotenuse = 15/17.	This would be the value of tan(A) or cot(B).	This is the reciprocal of sin(A), which would be csc(A).	This is the correct answer because angles A and B are the two acute angles in a right triangle, making them complementary. Therefore, sin(A) = cos(B).
EOC-M-C2-Geometry-Q5	EOC-M-C2-Geometry	Math	Geometry and Trigonometry	Area and volume	Hard	A cylinder has a volume of 128π cubic inches and a height of 8 inches. What is the radius of the cylinder's base?		2 inches	4 inches	8 inches	16 inches	4 inches	The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr²h. We are given V = 128π and h = 8. So, 128π = πr²(8). Divide both sides by 8π to get 16 = r². Take the square root of both sides to find r = 4.	To solve this, we start with the formula for the volume of a cylinder: V = πr²h. We are given the volume V = 128π and the height h = 8. We can plug these values into the formula: 128π = π * r² * 8. Our goal is to solve for the radius, r. First, we can divide both sides of the equation by π to get 128 = 8r². Next, divide both sides by 8 to isolate r²: 128 / 8 = r², which simplifies to 16 = r². Finally, take the square root of both sides to find r: √16 = r, so r = 4.	This answer is incorrect. It may result from a miscalculation after finding r² = 16.	This is the correct answer. When 128π is divided by 8π, the result is 16. The square root of 16 is 4.	This value is the height, not the radius. Be careful not to mix up the variables.	This value is r², not r. You correctly isolated r² but forgot to take the square root.
EOC-R-C1-VocabInContext-Q1	EOC-R-C1-VocabInContext	Reading	Information and Ideas	Words in Context	Easy	As used in the text, "championed" most nearly means... \n\nText: The town councilwoman was a tireless advocate for environmental protection. She championed the new recycling program, speaking at public forums and writing letters to convince residents of its benefits.		Supported	Defeated	Criticized	Invented	Supported	The context shows the councilwoman was an "advocate" who spoke at forums to convince residents. This indicates she supported the program.	The question asks for the meaning of "championed" in the given context. The text describes a councilwoman as a "tireless advocate" who worked to "convince residents" of the recycling program's benefits. These actions—advocating and convincing—are forms of strong support. Therefore, "supported" is the word that best captures the meaning of "championed" in this sentence.	This is the correct answer. To champion a cause is to fight for or support it.	This is the opposite of the word's meaning in context. Her actions show she was in favor of the program, not against it.	This is the opposite of the word's meaning in context. To criticize is to find fault, but she was promoting the program's benefits.	While she supported the program, the text does not state that she was the one who created or invented it.
EOC-R-C1-VocabInContext-Q2	EOC-R-C1-VocabInContext	Reading	Information and Ideas	Words in Context	Medium	As used in the text, "exploit" most nearly means... \n\nText: Early industrialists were eager to exploit the region's vast natural resources, building mines and factories at an unprecedented rate. While this led to economic growth, it also caused significant environmental damage.		Utilize	Replenish	Preserve	Waste	Utilize	The text says industrialists built mines and factories to use the resources for economic growth. "Utilize" means to make use of.	The word "exploit" can have a negative connotation, but its primary meaning is to make full use of and derive benefit from a resource. The context describes industrialists building mines and factories to use the "vast natural resources" for "economic growth." This points to the meaning of utilization. While the outcome had a negative side (environmental damage), the action itself was one of using the resources.	This is the correct answer. The context of building mines and factories to use resources for growth aligns perfectly with the meaning of "utilize."	This is an antonym. To replenish is to restore a supply, whereas the industrialists were taking from the supply.	This is an antonym. To preserve is to keep something in its existing state, but the industrialists were actively changing the environment.	While the actions could be seen as wasteful from an environmental perspective, the industrialists' intent was to use the resources for production, not simply to waste them.
EOC-R-C1-VocabInContext-Q3	EOC-R-C1-VocabInContext	Reading	Information and Ideas	Words in Context	Medium	As used in the text, "ubiquitous" most nearly means... \n\nText: In the first decade of the 21st century, smartphones were a luxury item. By the third decade, they had become ubiquitous, with nearly every person, from young children to the elderly, owning one.		Scarce	Expensive	Widespread	Complex	Widespread	The text contrasts the past, when smartphones were a "luxury," with the present, when "nearly every person" owns one. This indicates they are now widespread.	The sentence structure provides a strong clue by contrasting the past state ("luxury item") with the present state. The key detail is that "nearly every person, from young children to the aelderly, own[s] one." An item owned by nearly everyone in a population is best described as widespread or ever-present.	This is the opposite of the intended meaning. The text explicitly states they are no longer scarce as they once were.	While they may still be expensive, the context is focused on how common they are, not their price. The contrast is between being a "luxury" and being owned by everyone.	This is the correct answer. The detail that "nearly every person" owns one directly supports the meaning of "widespread."	The text doesn't comment on the complexity of smartphones, only on how commonly they are owned.
EOC-R-C1-VocabInContext-Q4	EOC-R-C1-VocabInContext	Reading	Information and Ideas	Words in Context	Hard	As used in the text, "pragmatic" most nearly means... \n\nText: While her colleagues debated the theoretical merits of various educational philosophies, the principal took a more pragmatic approach. She implemented a new tutoring program that, while not philosophically perfect, directly addressed the students' falling test scores.		Idealistic	Practical	Complicated	Emotional	Practical	The text contrasts the principal's approach with her colleagues' "theoretical" debates. She took an action that "directly addressed" a problem, which is a practical approach.	The key to understanding "pragmatic" here is the contrast the sentence sets up. The colleagues are focused on "theoretical merits," which suggests abstract ideas. The principal, however, takes an approach that "directly addressed the students' falling test scores." This focus on real-world results and solutions over abstract theory is the essence of pragmatism. Her approach was practical.	This is what the principal's approach is contrasted with. The colleagues were being idealistic, while she was being pragmatic.	This is the correct answer. A pragmatic person is concerned with practical results and consequences rather than theories and ideas.	The text doesn't suggest her approach was complicated; in fact, it was a direct solution to a problem.	The text provides no information about the principal's emotional state, but rather describes her method of problem-solving.
EOC-R-C1-VocabInContext-Q5	EOC-R-C1-VocabInContext	Reading	Information and Ideas	Words in Context	Easy	As used in the text, "luminous" most nearly means... \n\nText: The artist was famous for her landscape paintings. She had a unique ability to capture the way the moonlight made the snowy fields appear luminous, as if they were glowing from within.		Dark	Distant	Shining	Cold	Shining	The text provides a direct clue, stating the fields appeared "luminous, as if they were glowing from within." This means luminous means shining or bright.	The sentence itself provides a definition. The word "luminous" is explained by the phrase that follows it: "as if they were glowing from within." Things that glow are bright and shining. Therefore, "shining" is the best synonym for "luminous" in this context.	This is an antonym for luminous. The text describes a scene lit by moonlight, not a dark one.	While the fields might be distant, the word "luminous" describes their appearance (how they look), not their location.	This is the correct answer. The phrase "glowing from within" is a synonym for shining.	While snowy fields are cold, "luminous" describes the quality of the light on them, not their temperature.
CB-T1-M1-Q1	CB-T1-M1	Math	Algebra	Linear equations in 1 variable	Easy	If 3x + 9 = 15, what is the value of 6x?		2	6	12	18	12	First, solve for x. Subtract 9 from both sides: 3x = 6. Divide by 3: x = 2. Then, calculate 6x. 6 * 2 = 12.	This is a two-step problem. First, you must solve the linear equation for x. To do this, subtract 9 from both sides of the equation: 3x + 9 - 9 = 15 - 9, which gives 3x = 6. Then, divide both sides by 3 to find x = 2. The second step is to find the value of the expression 6x. Substitute the value of x you found: 6 * (2) = 12.	This is the value of x, not 6x. Be sure to answer the question that is being asked.	This is the value of 3x, not 6x. You have done the first step of solving the equation but not the final step of calculation.	This is the correct answer. Solving 3x+9=15 gives x=2. Then 6*2=12.	This answer may result from incorrectly solving for x (e.g., 15-9=6, 6+3=9, so x=3) and then calculating 6*3=18. Pay close attention to algebraic rules.
CB-T1-M1-Q2	CB-T1-M1	Math	Problem-Solving and Data Analysis	Ratios, Rates, and Proportions	Easy	A recipe calls for 2 cups of flour to make 18 cookies. How many cups of flour are needed to make 72 cookies?		4	6	8	10	8	Set up a proportion: (2 cups / 18 cookies) = (x cups / 72 cookies). To get from 18 to 72, you multiply by 4. So, multiply 2 by 4 to get x = 8.	This problem can be solved using ratios and proportions. First, determine the relationship between the number of cookies you want to make and the number the recipe makes: 72 cookies / 18 cookies = 4. This means you are making 4 batches of the recipe. Therefore, you must multiply the amount of flour by 4 as well: 2 cups * 4 = 8 cups.	This answer is incorrect. It might be the result of a miscalculation.	This answer may come from incorrectly setting up the ratio, perhaps by dividing 72 by 12 instead of 18.	This is the correct answer. Since 72 is 4 times 18, you need 4 times the amount of flour, which is 4 * 2 = 8.	This answer is incorrect. Check your multiplication or the ratio you set up.
CB-T1-M1-Q3	CB-T1-M1	Math	Advanced Math	Functions	Medium	The function f is defined by f(x) = x² - 8x + 10. What is the value of f(5)?		-5	5	10	25	-5	To find f(5), substitute 5 for x in the function definition: f(5) = (5)² - 8(5) + 10 = 25 - 40 + 10 = -5.	This question asks you to evaluate a function for a given input. To find the value of f(5), you need to replace every instance of 'x' in the function's formula with the number 5. So, f(5) = (5)² - 8(5) + 10. Following the order of operations, first calculate the exponent: 5² = 25. Then, perform the multiplication: 8(5) = 40. Now the expression is 25 - 40 + 10. Performing the subtraction and addition from left to right: 25 - 40 = -15, and -15 + 10 = -5.	This is the correct answer, calculated as 25 - 40 + 10.	This answer might be the result of a sign error, for example, 25 - 40 = -15, and -15 - 10 = -25. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let's try 40-25-10=5. This is a common error of mixing signs.	This is the value of the constant term, not the value of the function at x=5.	This is the value of x², the first term, not the value of the entire function.
CB-T1-M1-Q4	CB-T1-M1	Math	Algebra	Systems of linear equations	Medium	If 2a + b = 10 and a - b = 2, what is the value of a?		2	3	4	8	4	Use the elimination method. Add the two equations together: (2a + b) + (a - b) = 10 + 2. This simplifies to 3a = 12. Divide by 3 to get a = 4.	This problem provides a system of two linear equations with two variables. We can solve for 'a' using the elimination method. By adding the two equations together, the 'b' variables will cancel each other out. \n (2a + b) = 10 \n+(a - b) =  2 \n---------------- \n  3a + 0b = 12 \nThis simplifies to 3a = 12. To solve for a, divide both sides by 3: a = 12 / 3 = 4.	This would be the value of b. If a=4, then 4-b=2, so b=2.	This would be the result if 3a=10, not 12. Be sure to add the constants on the right side correctly.	This is the correct answer. Adding the two equations gives 3a = 12, so a = 4.	This answer might result from solving 10-2=8, but this does not correctly solve the system of equations.
CB-T1-M1-Q5	CB-T1-M1	Math	Problem-Solving and Data Analysis	Percentages	Medium	A store manager increases the price of a jacket by 20%. If the new price is $90, what was the original price of the jacket?		S70	S72	S75	S108	S75	Let the original price be P. The new price is P + 0.20P = 1.20P. So, 1.20P = 90. Divide 90 by 1.20 to find P. P = 90 / 1.2 = 75.	This problem requires you to reverse a percentage increase. Let P be the original price. A 20% increase means the new price is 100% of the original price plus 20% of the original price, which is 120% of P, or 1.20P. We are given that the new price is $90. So, we have the equation 1.20P = 90. To find the original price P, we must divide both sides by 1.20: P = 90 / 1.20. This gives P = 75. So, the original price was $75.	This answer comes from subtracting $20 from $90, but a percentage increase is multiplicative, not additive.	This answer comes from incorrectly calculating 20% of $90 (which is $18) and subtracting it. The 20% was calculated on the original, lower price, not the new, higher price.	This is the correct answer. $75 * 1.20 = $90.	This answer comes from incorrectly adding 20% of $90 to $90 (90 * 0.2 = 18; 90+18=108). This calculates a 20% increase from $90, not the original price.
